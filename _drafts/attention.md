I spend a lot of time faffing. Writing a blog post that never gets published. Creating an app that never sees the light of day. Acres and acres of storage, full of digital junk.

I've come to realise that this is (partially) an attention problem. I have a finite amount of "fucks to give" to a personal project. Things can be ticking along merrily. But then I either get distracted by something else, or I get frustrated about not making any progress, so I abandon the project altogether. 

So if I want to make progress on a pet project, I think I have to do two things:

1.  **Avoid going down rabbit-holes.**
2.  **Cut, cut and cut** until I have something which is _scruffy but shippable_. (I think I'll have to use this phrase again.)

(Even writing this blog post is difficult. I've written so many drafts and started down enough rabbit-holes, that I've had to forcefully rein myself back in, and remind myself what I actually want to write about.)
