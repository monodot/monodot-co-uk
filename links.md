Here are some links and resources that I like and use on a regular basis. Sharing is caring!

## My stack

- [GoAccess](https://goaccess.io/) - This is an open source web server log analyser. I use this to produce stats for this website, and others. It's easily installed on CentOS.

- [Uptime Robot][uptimerobot] - This is a great, super-simple, free tool for monitoring up to 50 websites. It alerts me by email when any of my websites are down. This is incredibly useful when you're just a solo webmaster, and you don't have time to set up a fancy monitoring solution!

## iOS apps

### Productivity

- [1Writer][1writer-web] (iOS app) - This is such an **awesome note-taking app**, and I would be absolutely lost without it. Read and write plaintext files to your Dropbox, with smooth syncing functionality, Markdown support, dark mode and lots more. 

### Travel

- [Foursquare][foursquare-web] ([app][foursquare-ios]) - it's not as trendy as it used to be, but it's still awesome for finding local food &amp; drink places. It's very useful when I'm travelling somewhere new.

- [LuckyTrip][luckytrip] (iOS app) - This is instant holiday inspiration for a weekend break somewhere, with flights, accommodation and things to do, all matching your chosen budget.
