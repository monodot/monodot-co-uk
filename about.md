Hello! My name is Tom Donohue and this is my personal web site.

This site is to showcase the things I'm working on, and for random writings on my blog. I hope you find some of this useful!

Currently my main activities are:

- [Tom Donohue's Blog](https://tomd.xyz), a blog with tutorials on open source integration and middleware (like Apache Camel). This is where I share things I learn from my job as a software consultant.

- [My GitHub](https://github.com/monodot), where I share code and stuff

- [Knowledge Base](http://kb.tomd.xyz), a repository of cheatsheets and code snippets that I update regularly.

This site is made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [Clean Blog](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll) theme.

Thanks for visiting!

PS. **Why monodot?** Because it's an anagram of the first 7 letters of my name.
