Hello! My name is Tom Donohue and this is my web site. This site is to showcase the things Iâ€™m working on, and for random - but hopefully useful -writings on my blog.

Currently my main projects and activities are:

- [Integration Wire](https://integrationwire.com), a blog about open source integration, middleware and PaaS
- [My GitHub](https://github.com/monodot), where I post code and stuff

You can contact me:

- on Twitter [@monodot](https://twitter.com/monodot)
- by email, using _my first name_ @monodot.co.uk

This site is made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [Hagura](http://webjeda.com/hagura) theme.

Thanks for visiting!
