Stuff I use and like on a regular basis!

## Webapps/SaaS

- [Uptime Robot][uptimerobot] - This is a great, super-simple, free tool for monitoring up to 50 websites. It alerts me by email when any of my sites are down. Incredibly useful when you're just a solo webmaster, and you don't have time to check everything manually or set up a fancy monitoring solution!

## iOS apps

### Productivity

- [1Writer][1writer-web] - awesome note-taking app; read and write plaintext to your Dropbox with great syncing functionality, Markdown support, dark mode and lots more.

### Travel

- [Foursquare][foursquare-web] ([app][foursquare-ios]) - it's not as trendy as it used to be, but it's still awesome for finding local food &amp; drink places. It's very useful when I travel somewhere new.
- [LuckyTrip][luckytrip] - instant holiday inspiration for a weekend break somewhere, with flights, accommodation and things to do, all matching your chosen budget.
