Stuff I use and like on a regular basis!

## iOS apps

### Productivity

- [MiniKeePass][minikeepassios] - [open source][minikeepassgithub] app for viewing and editing my KeePass file (for password storage). Uses fingerprint security and can save changes back to Dropbox.

### Travel

- [Foursquare][foursquare-web] ([app][foursquare-ios]) - it's not as trendy as it used to be, but it's still awesome for finding local food &amp; drink places. It's very useful when I travel somewhere new.
- [LuckyTrip][luckytrip] - instant holiday inspiration for a weekend break somewhere, with flights, accommodation and things to do, all matching your chosen budget.
