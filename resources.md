Stuff I use and like on a regular basis!

## iOS apps

### Productivity

- [MiniKeePass][minikeepassios] - [open source][minikeepassgithub] app for viewing and editing my KeePass file (for password storage). Uses fingerprint security and can save changes back to Dropbox.

### Travel

- [Foursquare][foursquare] - it's not as trendy any more, but it's awesome for finding local food &amp; drink places. Especially useful whenever I travel somewhere new.
- [LuckyTrip][luckytrip] - instant holiday inspiration for weekend breaks in Europe, with flights, accommodation and things to do, all matching your set budget.
