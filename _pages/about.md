Hello! My name is Tom Donohue and this is my personal web site. I'm a blogger and tech generalist and I live in London. I'm interested in software, writing, and egg sandwiches. 

This website is a place for me to share the things that I'm working on, my thoughts on side projects, and for random writings!

Currently my main activities are:

- [Tutorial Works](https://www.tutorialworks.com), a website for developers and engineers, focusing on high-quality tutorials on cloud-native software, Linux, DevOps, and much more. 

- [London Links](https://london-links.netlify.app), a curated list of websites for getting the most out of London.

- [Tom Donohue's Blog](https://tomd.xyz), a blog with my older tutorials on open source integration software (like Apache Camel). This is where I've shared things I learn from my job as a software consultant.

- [My GitHub](https://github.com/monodot), where I share code and stuff

- [Knowledge Base](https://kb.tomd.xyz), a general dump of tech notes and code snippets, which I update when I can.

This site is made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

Thanks for visiting! You can also [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/monodot).

PS. **Why monodot?** Because it's an anagram of the first 7 letters of my name.
