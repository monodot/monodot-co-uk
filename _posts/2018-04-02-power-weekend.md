It's Easter weekend. That means 4 days off work. Perfect time to get stuff done.

This weekend I didn't have much in the diary, so as well as getting in some much-needed R&R (sofa time, watching _Boss Baby_ and _Terminator_....), I also cleared these off my to-do list this weekend:

- Created and published a [landing page for my forthcoming book Camel Step-by-Step][landing]. I've decided to go with a soft launch for the book, rather than a big bang.

- Created [a product in Gumroad][gumroad] for the book - you can buy it now!

- Updated my [Drip][drip] post-subscribe campaign, by adding two new emails introducing the book

- Updated and expanded my previous "Introduction to Apache Camel" freebie into a full PDF sample of the book, published using Asciidoctor 

- Pushed an initial update to [one of my most popular articles, the Apache Camel Tutorial][tutorial] - with another update to follow

I have typed **a lot** this weekend. 

_This post is part of my ride-along series, where I'm recording my progress in building and launching a product in 2018._
