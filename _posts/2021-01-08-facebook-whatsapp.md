[Facebook is making another grab for my data][1], this time through WhatsApp. 

The valuable data in my phone book, my connections, location, social interactions and more, are all ripe for the taking.

I can either give Facebook permission to do this, or I can decline, and stop using the app.

If I decline, I'll be locked out of conversations with friends and family, some conversations stretching back many years.

Some people suggest moving to a privacy-focused messaging app, like Signal.

**The problem is: I now have to convince _all_ of my friends to do the same.**

My friends don't share all the same views as me. (This is a good thing.)

But if I have personal concerns about privacy, and I still want to keep in contact with friends and family, I have no choice but to use these apps.

I have caved in, and accepted the new terms of service.

The market, given free rein, has failed.

Online communication tools are not a choice any more. They are a utility, used by billions, and need to be treated as such.

Telephony is regulated. I have the choice to move my phone number between providers. I can phone any other phone number, even if it's on a different network.

So why aren't the same freedoms guaranteed with online communications?
