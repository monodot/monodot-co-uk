Yes, I'm writing a book.

**Why?**

For the past few years I've harboured an increasing desire to release _something_ on the internet. 

A long time ago I used to create things - anything from web pages to radio shows to DJ mixes. But for the past few years I've felt like I've creatively stagnated.

In my day job as a software consultant I spend every day creating things for customers. 

So how difficult can it be to create something for the general public, _under my own steam_?

The answer is -- at least, for me -- very difficult.

## Creating is hard

When I'm given direction, I have no problem creating things. 

Tell me what the problem is, and I'll use my skills to create a solution, or at least make things better.

But creating on my own is much, much harder.

I tend to be a perfectionist, and can be very self-critical of what I do. 

This makes it very difficult to pick one path and stick to it. 

I usually become disillusioned with my own efforts and abandon a project halfway through. 

To paraphrase [Amy Hoy][amyhoy], my computer is littered with the graves of hundreds of half-finished projects. _RIP_ ⚰⚰⚰

Why do I never finish projects?

I think it's that I need to see some **tangible measure of success** at an early stage. 

Before I launch head first into a project, I need to be sure that I'm going down the right path. 

If I don't see any early success, my interest dwindles, and I find myself quickly back at square one, which I call "the incessant list-making/note-taking phase" (I am very good at note-taking)

## So what's changed?

For 2017, I set myself a goal of launching "one tiny product". I didn't achieve that. 

Summer rolled on into Autumn, and before I knew it, it was the end of 2017 and I had come nowhere near to that goal.

In December, I purged all my subscribers in my Drip account and made a fresh start. 

I re-enabled some opt-in forms on [Clever Builder][cleverbuilder] and, to my surprise, subscriber growth has been steady at a rate of about 2-3 per day since the start of December.

In fact, traffic on Cleverbuilder.com has been **slowly climbing** over the past year. Google seems to be sending me more traffic (yes, my traffic is almost exclusively Google referrals) which translates to more eyeballs and more sign-ups.

This made me think that there is perhaps some interest in what I'm writing. 

## What product to create?

My most popular posts on _Clever Builder_ are about the Apache Camel library for Java.

Most people visit the site through Google, via searches for _"apache camel tutorial"_ and others.

There is clearly a market of people who are looking for tutorials about this framework.

I see some potential value in taking topics from my most popular posts, writing about them in more detail and making a beginner-friendly book about Apache Camel.

## On the road to a book

Yesterday, I added some new opt-in forms which specifically reference a forthcoming Camel book. And within just a few hours, I already got a sign-up.

I've got a long way to go before that interest grows into a potential audience for a book, of course.

But, inspired by others in the developer-turned-author space, such as [Adam Wathan][adamwathan] and [Thorben Janssen][thorben], I'm making my own start. 

I get a lot of value by reading others' honest blog posts, so I'll be trying to post updates from my product creation journey on this blog. 

I need to learn that it's better to have tried and failed, than to have never finished anything.

So please watch this space if you want to know more!
