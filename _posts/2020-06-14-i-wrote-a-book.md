In 2018, I wrote and released a programming book.

Now, as I'm updating it, I wanted to document my experiences. I want to write an article that I would have benefited from reading myself 5 years ago, to encourage me to just stop dithering and start.

. . .

Like a lot of people, I've always had dreams in my head of coming up with some _killer idea_. And also like many people, my _Killer_ideas.txt_ file is full of utter rubbish that I'll never build.

While I was waiting for that golden idea to arrive in my lap, I thought I would take the intermediate step of starting a blog.

Starting a blog is so easy. I set up a WordPress site and started sharing things I know in programming. My blog was called _Integration Wire_ and it was going to be solely about _application integration_.

_I think this detail is important, because initially I had the naÃ¯ve thought that I needed to publish content under a "brand". I later realised that's rubbish, and today my blog's name is basically my name ([Tom D's tech blog][tomd])._

(By the way, _application integration_ is the thing that happens in big companies when they need to pull data out of their HR system and put it into Payroll, things like that. It's one of my tech interests, and also a multi-million pound business, dominated by "enterprise" tech companies you've never heard of.)

One of my hopes in writing the blog was to try to chip away at the nagging feeling I get that I don't deserve to be in my position at work (some people call this _impostor syndrome_). I thought that by teaching everything I know, it would help me realise that my knowledge is quite broad, and that I _do_ have chops to be where I am today.

I also wanted to create things to help human beings. I create things at work all the time, but a lot of those things can be summed-up as a few dozen lines of code. Reaching an individual person, and helping them solve their problems, is a completely different experience.

I had some experience working with application integration software, so I decided to focus on that. I decided to create the kind of content I would have found useful as a beginner. I thought that if I would have appreciated it, then someone else would do too.

After a year or two of writing, I'd built up a basic collection of articles on the blog. I didn't write very often, perhaps once a month at most. I added a comments plugin to the website, and started to answer some questions from readers.

I never once wrote a guest post for other blog, did any link-building or any of that SEO stuff. I'd read about all of those tactics, but the truth is I wasn't really comfortable in drawing attention to my work.

I had the belief that if I wrote sufficient quality content, and Google had indexed it, that people would find it, eventually. Whether this is universally true or not, is debatable.

But that describes what actually happened. I appeared in the search results and people found my content. To this day, I'm very reliant on Google for traffic.

I started to get hits, which spurred me on to write more articles.

## Unblocking to get started

The next stage in the journey came at the start of 2017, when, instead of adding another crazy idea to my _App_Ideas.txt_, I began to wonder whether I could find a way to expand on my writing instead. I was getting several thousand visitors a month on the site. It seemed logical to double-down on something that was working.

But I became blocked before even starting.

I brainstormed a list of topics that I know about, which intersect with topics that people want to learn. I went round in circles _many times_, unsure of what to write about.

Should I write about something that I'm less experienced in, but is more popular?

Do I even know enough about any subject to write about it?

After creating endless lists, I decided to keep it simple, and focus on what I'd spent most of my time doing in the last year. This would mean writing a book on [Apache Camel][camel].

Apache Camel is a framework for integration developers. It's a relatively niche open-source library, in just one programming language (Java). But it isn't so niche that it's an under-served market. There are already books out there on Apache Camel, including the excellent [Camel In Action][cia], which I bought and had learned a lot from.

But I still had blockers: But my topic is too niche! And: I can't create something that already exists!

I needed to unblock myself so I could begin writing.

Firstly, I discovered that if a book already exists in a niche, it's not a bad thing ; it's a good thing. If there are books which already serve this audience, that's very good news, because it means that people want to know about the topic.

The second thing that got me unstuck was this quote from Sean Wes:

> [There's nothing new under the sun, so stop trying to be original.][seanwes]

-- Sean Wes

It's OK to write a book on a subject which has already been covered before. How many books are there on making bread? Or writing JavaScript? Probably quite a lot.

Voice and style, combined with a topic, make the output unique.

I wanted to share a book on Camel for absolute beginners, written in the same style as my blog. I might say different things to other writers, or structure my thoughts in a different way.

I planned to call it Camel Step-by-Step. And by now I was ready to start writing.

## The saga of writing

I started writing in February 2018, and I tried to write whenever I had both the free time and the enthusiasm to do so. I had no previous experience of estimating time for a project like this, but I set myself a target word count of 30,000 words and an optimistic release date of August.

Fortunately, I was in a position of having my blog content, which was ready to be expanded and added into the book. This was a real boost.

To prevent myself from getting blocked again just thinking about the table of contents, I decided to plan the book as a set of mostly-independent chapters. This meant that knowledge from one chapter wouldn't always be required to read the next one. It would also make the job of writing individual chapters much easier, not having to worry too much about flow.

After an initial buzzy start, the next few months of writing became less of an enjoyable side project and more of a chore. My original August launch date slipped to September, and then further. Then my job got pretty busy, and I found myself with less energy to work on the book. At weekends I wanted to catch up and see friends instead of writing.

I was approaching that stage in any project where it becomes harder to get over the finish line. This is the point when everything seems to be convincing you to give up or, even worse, just silently abandon.

To try to keep myself on track, I set up a system to track my words written. With my 30,000 word count goal in mind, I recorded my daily writing on a spreadsheet, so I could visualise my progress.

I woke up early so that I could squeeze in an hour's writing before work. I hit a quiet local coffee shop in the morning, and hit the keyboard uninterrupted as the world outside started to wake up and go to work.

I stripped back my _nice-to-haves_. I cut the scope of the book and skipped some chapters that I had originally planned. I just needed to get it finished.

Slowly but surely, I could see the end was in sight.

## The launch

I remember the day that I received my first pre-order. It was half-way through writing the book, and I'd put some information on the blog about my project.

Getting the first preorder was so motivating! Someone had a problem, they found my website, found my content helpful and considered the offer to be worth paying for. I'll always be thankful to that first person.

This never would have happened if I hadn't put some information on my blog about the book. I recommend everyone to do this while writing. Don't wait until the very end to announce it to the world.

_(I still find this simple idea of being an independent content creator very inspiring, even though we just take it for granted now. Not so long ago, writing a book would have required pairing with a publisher and waiting months to see a product in print.)_

As the weeks went by, a couple more pre-orders rolled in.

I had mostly finished writing by October, but I pushed the launch date further back because I wanted to spend time working on the book's code examples. I'd cut some chapters, but decided I really wanted to bundle examples, as I always find them useful when I'm learning anything.

By this point, I just wanted to get the book out there. I was sick of reading chapters, re-writing sections, and trying to stop myself from making more work.

I never did a big launch, or advertising. I had put together a small mailing list for people who were interested (about 100 people at the time). I put together a [landing page][landing], linked it to my product in Gumroad, and sent out the first edition to those who had preordered. All those months spent writing, and the product was finally online!

During the first 3 months I sold 25 copies of the book. Since then, I don't do much publicity for the book, other than the links on my blog, but it still sells 1 or 2 copies per month.

## How I feel about it now

Writing a book still feels like a huge achievement.

As I've been reviewing the book recently, I've looked at the table of contents and I've been asking myself, _Did I really write all of this?_ I see the word count and I wonder where all of those words actually came from.

Overall, I've sold 75 copies since the book was launched. It's not earth-shattering, but it's 75 people who got help with their problems. I often think about those individual readers, what they got out of the book and what they're doing now.

Writing a book was my first step in returning to a role as content creator, rather than just passive content consumer.

Many of us were encouraged to create at school or college; either through coursework, presentations or clubs and societies.

But as grown-ups we're less willing to put ourselves out there, and we are more likely to just read and share articles like this one. It's been great to put something out there and say "I created this".

Writing the book helped me at work. This was an unexpected but nice side effect. People came to me asking about the book, even though I barely mentioned I was even writing it.

I'm now "the guy that wrote the book" in my team, although I still don't really feel like it.

I'm keen to continue this journey somehow, but I'm unsure where to go with it next. Possibly I'm over-thinking that right now. But writing on a very niche topic does make it easy for you to be pigeon-holed. _(Yes, I'm blocked again.)_

## What I would tell myself 5 years ago

So back to the purpose of this article. I said I wanted to write to myself.

In this article I've shared my process, and the various self-imposed hurdles that I had to overcome to complete a book.

Everyone's situation is different, and what appears easy to some might not be so easy for you. I'm sharing my experiences here to show you what I struggled with. You might not have the same issues. But the only way you'll really know how it goes **is by doing it**.

To myself of five years ago:

Just start writing. All the preparation, research and note-taking in the world means nothing without progress and output. If it's not published to the world, it might as well not exist.

**Create a blog and write blog posts.** These nuggets will grow your confidence and credibility, and will help establish a structure for your first book.

**Be proud of your style.** The things that make your voice unique should be emphasised in your writing, not suppressed. I've found it hard to find my own writing style, and it's still often tempting to weaken my own voice in favour of pleasing the mainstream. Don't do that! Be yourself.

**Experiment more.** The web is an excellent place for experimenting. If something doesn't work, you can remove it or change it straight away. Don't wait for one single amazing idea to hit you. You can try lots of things out.

**No-one cares.** (This is one of the most important things!) You can put something online, but billions of people won't notice. They won't notice if you make a typo, or a mistake in your technical writing. Sorry, but most people will never see your life's best work. It might seem that by putting your work out there, you put yourself on show to millions. For the majority of people, this will probably never be true.

**Plan and track progress on paper.** This is a recent learning for me. I'm well-experienced in writing organised to-do lists in text files, but then not really acting on any of it. Only this year, I've finally realised that I'm not very good at keeping track if my task list exists solely in a digital format. The act of writing things down on paper (e.g. bullet-journalling) has been a revelation for me recently.

**Try to stop self-sabotaging.** I often think that my work is not good enough, or not useful, or will be full of mistakes. I think it's my subconscious trying to cushion any potential blows. (Even while writing this article I can hear that same inner-voice talking!) But there comes a time when you've just got to ignore that voice, otherwise you will never achieve your potential. Try to turn the volume down on that voice and just carry on.

## Conclusion

Writing a book has helped me grow in many ways. It has improved my writing, helped me realise what I can achieve if I focus, and helped me at work.

I think you should do it too. You can create content that people will appreciate. Even if you feel that you're working in the deepest, most obscure technical field, or that you haven't got knowledge worth sharing, your combination of experience and voice is unique, so share it.

If this article inspires you to start your own blog or write a book, let me know! I would love to hear your story.
