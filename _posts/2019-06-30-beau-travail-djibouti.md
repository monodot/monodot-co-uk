I don't really have much of a desire to join the French Foreign Legion.

But after watching Clare Denis's film **Beau Travail**, I might add Djibouti to my bucket list.

I don't know anything about the country, but the movie was filmed on location there, and there are some great shots of the country. This part of the country looks pretty bleak, at least:

And some extreme ironing:

I do like getting to watch very obscure films on Mubi. Stuff I would never normally know about, or hunt down. Glad I made the effort with this one.
