Here's a useful tip I found purely by accident. Useful if you have multiple Google accounts that you often need to switch between.

**Do you have several Google accounts?**

Perhaps one for work, one for business, and a couple of those throwaway ones for mailing lists? (don't worry, I won't tell anyone.)

Are some of your accounts activated for _Inbox by Google_, but others are still on plain old Gmail?

**Do you hate seeing this splash page?** Ugh, yep.

![Inbox by Google is disabled for your domain]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/inbox-disabled-domain.png)

Then you may like to know that you can **access Gmail for another Google Account directly, by simply adding your email address to the URL for Gmail**, like this:

<big>https://mail.google.com/mail/u/_youremailaddress@gmail.com_</big>

(Note that you need to be logged in to the account for this trick to work)

![Switching to a different Gmail account]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/gmail-switch.png)

When you go to this URL, Google will switch to that account automatically, and load your Gmail inbox for that account.

![Loading your other Gmail inbox]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/gmail-switch-2.png)

**Google Apps user?** If you also get your work email through Google (Google Apps/G-Suite), then this also works too:

<big>https://mail.google.com/mail/u/_mrfancypants@bigcompany.com_</big>

Do it now! Create yourself a bookmark and access your Gmail account quickly. Saves me at least 5 seconds every time I do it. :-)

One for the real Gmail power users: if you want fast Google account switching _and other funky stuff_ wrapped up in a desktop app, and you don't mind spending $20 a year for it, then you might be interested in [Shift][1].
