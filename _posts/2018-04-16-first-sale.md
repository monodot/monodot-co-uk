Huge week to share with you!

This week I presold my first three copies of _Camel Step by Step_, my beginners guide to Apache Camel ebook. I made my first sale last Monday, and then made two more later in the week. 

Yay!

This is the first time I've offered up a product for sale online, and I'm very excited to have made sales. This happened without any spammy marketing campaigns, "outreach" or even any backlink building.

My sole strategy is writing decent content, hoping to get indexed by Google and helping people out.

I'm actually still writing the book, but last week I made it available as a "soft pre-launch". This is where I'm taking pre-orders for the book at a discounted price. 

This has two main benefits:

- For the reader, they get a prelaunch discount on the final book, which will be priced at $29 or higher. They also get to influence the content of the book: I'm taking suggestions from the community on what they'd like to see in the final content.
- For me, it allows me to gauge interest level in the book and see whether it's a product worth creating. I've read a lot of blogs which recommend doing this, rather than spending months locked away creating a product, only to launch it with a huge fanfare and quickly discover that nobody wanted it in the first place.

To "launch", I created a simple landing page and extended my current email campaign I send to new subscribers by adding a new email introducing the product. 

I haven't emailed my existing subscribers (of which there are just under 180), probably because I'm a bit afraid of asking for a sale without providing more value somehow. 

That's a fear that probably I need to get over.

I'm taking pre-orders for the book at a discount on the final price ($19 instead of $29). 

And this week I made the first sales! I hadn't expected it to happen. I just put up the sales page on the chance that somebody might be interested.

So how did those sales happen? It starts with helping people.

## Helping people

On Clever Builder, I encourage comments and messages from blog readers. Readers can interact with me in three ways:

1. I have comments forms on every article (powered by Disqus - soon to change to Isso commenting engine).
2. Mailing list subscribers can hit reply to any email, and email me directly with questions or feedback.
3. There is also a [traditional contact form][contact] where people can send messages and ask questions

This is because I like to hear from readers, to know if the stuff I'm producing is actually useful to someone. 

My strategy at the moment is just throwing content out there into _the cold, unforgiving void of the internet_.

_So how do you stay motivated if you don't know if your content is really resonating with anyone?_

So I've tried to solicit feedback where I can.

Over the past couple of weeks, I've been exchanging emails with a blog reader from the USA. He originally got in touch via the contact form to ask a couple of questions about Camel.

I took time to respond to his question, responded freely to his follow-up questions, and eventually left him with a working example that demonstrated how he could achieve his requirement. 

In response, the reader enquired about pre-ordering the book! He said he received quite a lot of value from me and was happy to support the book in return. I was surprised when my first notification from Gumroad came through to say that I'd made a sale. 

**Result!**

The reader has also since emailed me to say that he's looking forward to receiving the book when it's released. 

## Customers 2 and 3

My second and third sales also took me by surprise.

I was at work a couple of days later, still thinking about my first sale, and thinking about writing this very blog post to share my news. 

I went to my Gumroad dashboard to take a screengrab. And I was very puzzled when I saw that my dashboard was showing three sales.

I put this down to one of my previous test purchases showing up erroneously. But, on further glance, it definitely looked like I'd made two new sales somehow. 

When I looked at the sales data, it seemed that a further sale had come from someone else who I'd been helping with her Camel questions over email. So, again, helping people and answering questions led to a sale.

My final sale came from someone who I had not interacted with directly, but who was on my mailing list. 

These two sales came in one day! I took the train home with quite the spring in my step. 

So in all three cases, sales came from people who I had either helped out with their individual questions, or who I'd built up a relationship with via my freebies and my mailing list.

# That feeling 

This is the first product that I've created. It's an amazing feeling to know that people actually want to buy something you created. 

I previously worried that I was serving a tiny, difficult niche (enterprise integration developers!), and that it would be impossible to make a sale. 

But my sales this week show that's simply not true. If you can provide value for someone, they will buy from you. 

I'm buoyed by these sales and can't wait to finish the book. The great bonus is that I now have some sales data that I can start using to improve what I offer for my blog readers. 

Onward!

_This post is part of my ride-along series, where I'm recording my progress in building and launching a product in 2018._
