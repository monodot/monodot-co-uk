Here's my final quarterly review of 2018, and a quick look at 2019.

If you're eagle-eyed, you'll notice that there wasn't a Q3 review. I'll explain why later.

My current side projects are:

- [Clever Builder][cb] - articles on programming, mostly Java, and more specifically around [Apache Camel][camel].

- [Camel Step-by-Step][camelsbs] - a book I've been writing, on Apache Camel for beginners.

- [Flat Haus][fh] - a small home decor website and [Instagram account][fh-insta] - I'm not doing much with this site at the moment, as I don't have the time.

## Clever Builder

User numbers for Clever Builder rose to 19,564 - not much of an increase, but that's because I didn't really add any major new content to the site, and didn't improve existing content either:

This quarter, I wrote **one** new article. Yes, just one article:

- [JBoss/Wildfly: Setting a custom resource adapter for an MDB][mdbra]

- (crickets...)

This one article was just a quick braindump of things I found out when I went to see a customer.

Other than that, I found it really hard to find any time to update the website.

## Thoughts

**Having no time**

I was pretty busy in the second half of this year. Work got busier, and with more travelling involved.

I had a few weekend breaks with some amazing friends.

As a result of both, I was flying almost every week.

That used up a lot of my energy, and I felt I had less drive to write articles, or even work on the book.

If I'm spending all week travelling and working intensely on a computer, I just don't want to stare at a laptop screen on Saturdays and Sundays.

I managed 1 blog post on Clever Builder, and even that was a really quick write-up of some rough notes I'd had!

I also didn't write a quarterly review on this site either.

Lesson learned: travelling and side projects don't mix easily!

**Delaying launching**

I originally slated [Camel Step-by-Step][camelsbs] for completion towards the end of Summer 2018 -- and by this, I was meaning around August.

But this date slipped... a lot!

The book is meant to be a general guide to Apache Camel for beginners, but defining the boundaries of what a beginner needs to know is very difficult. This means it's hard to know when the book is "finished".

So I kept adding more chapters to the book, and then I started to produce some bonus content (six sample Camel applications).

I'm satisfied with the book now, but I know in future that I need to be more strict on knowing when a project is "done". Scope creep is even a real thing on personal projects.

## Reading list

I read more books in 2018 than I probably have in the previous 5 years combined. My highlights this quarter were:

- **Anything You Want by Derek Sivers** - an excellent guide to how Derek Sivers started and grew _CD Baby_. It's such a tiny wee book but packed full of useful stuff about how to create what people want.

- **Do Open by David Hieatt** - a great book on starting and growing an email newsletter.

- **The One Thing by Jay Papasan** - one of those motivational books that are a bit of an enjoyable waste of time. The takeaway message: just focus on one thing, rather than flitting about between different things. (At least, I think that was the message!)

## Goals for 2019

This year has been a big experiment for me. I've written a book and released it into the world. YIKES.

I've learned so much. I know for sure that I don't want to work on another book just yet.

In 2019 I'm not currently planning to launch anything major. I just want to continue to grow [Clever Builder][cb], and concentrate on creating useful stuff for people.
