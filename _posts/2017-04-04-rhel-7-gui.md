When you don't have a graphical desktop in Red Hat Enterprise Linux, either because you've disabled it, or because you just don't have it installed...

Yikes. Such text.

You can switch to GUI mode (desktop) in RHEL 7 by doing the following:

**First, as root, use _yum_ to install the packages required** for the graphical desktop:

    # yum groupinstall graphical-server-environment

Then, **tell _systemd_** that it should start services for the graphical desktop on startup. This is done using a target. [_Targets_ are a way of grouping related services together in _systemd_][1]. You can list all targets using `systemctl list-units --type target`.

So, to set the _graphical_ target as the default on startup:

    # systemctl set-default graphical.target

Then finally, you can **start the graphical environment** (X) manually from the command line using _startx_:

    # startx

_Et... voila_:

Now, have a cocktail to celebrate. üç∏
