Hello! Here's what I'm up to right now. Last updated January 2021:

- I'm living in London and working as a consultant at Red Hat, where I've been since 2016\. Right now I'm permanently working from home due to [COVID-19 lockdown][lockd]. I'm trying to get out for exercise most days, but not always keeping up to my noble goal ;-)

- I've just started a new web site, _Tutorial Works_, which I'm building up slowly with tech tutorials and articles. 

  I want to use it as a launchpad for improving my blogging and publishing skills. I've always been interested in writing, and in 2020 I finally decided to embrace imperfection and just start publishing more. _Tutorial Works_ is my platform for that. So I'm going all-in on publishing and teaching everything I know.
  
  My intention is to build up the traffic for the site over the coming months. It's still early days yet, but I'm excited about the journey!

- I'm inspired by the idea of **digital gardens**. I'm using [Foam][foam] to do my personal planning and note-taking, and wondering how I can use the digital garden approach when writing and publishing online.
