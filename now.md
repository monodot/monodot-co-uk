_Inspired by Derek Sivers's Now page movement_

Hello! Here's what I'm up to right now. Last updated June 2020:

- I'm living in London and working as a consultant at Red Hat, where I've been since 2016\. Right now I'm permanently working from home due to [COVID-19 lockdown][lockd].

- Making fledgling attempts to bake my own sourdough bread. I think I got some decent results on my first couple of bakes due to [this great recipe from Charles][charles], but I'm enjoying eating [spring onion sourdough flatbreads][flatbreads] made with the leftover starter even more. ðŸ¤¤

- Buying records! With my new-found free time, I dusted off my turntables and I've been buying records again and loving it. I've also been doing a few streams on Twitch on Saturdays as [Cheese Analogue][ca]. Also: watching rotary mixer videos on YouTube, following [DJ-setup Instagram accounts][doyouspin], and enjoying hunting for house, techno and vaporwave tracks on [Bandcamp][bc]

- Updating my [Camel Step-by-Step][camelsbs] book for beginners, for the latest Camel 3 release.
