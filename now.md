Hello! Here's what I'm up to right now. Last updated November 2021:

- I'm living in London and working as a consultant at Red Hat, where I've been working since 2016\. I specialise in things like integration, Java development, cloud/Kubernetes and DevOps, fixing and designing things for customers. I'm still mostly working from home, due to [COVID-19 lockdown][lockd].

- I'm building up my newest web site, [Tutorial Works][tw], which I started in November 2020. I'm slowly building up a bunch of tech tutorials and articles. 

  I really enjoy writing for the site, and think of it like a little puzzle that I can keep coming back to, adding another piece here and there. I'm intending to write more at the start of 2022, and maybe even write a book for the site.

- I've been working on a webapp called [Apoll][apoll]. It scratches an itch I had this year: I needed a tool to gather feedback from online meetings -- like an NPS score, basically. At the time, I couldn't find anything which was simple and free, so I created my own. And I really enjoyed the process! So check it out if you want a simple way of gathering feedback on your next workshop/sales meeting/quiz night/whatever.
