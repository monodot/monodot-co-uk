Hello! Here's what I'm up to right now. Last updated August 2022:

- I'm living in London, and working in consulting at Red Hat (although I'm leaving soon).

- I'm still working on my main tech website, [Tutorial Works][tw], which I started in November 2020. I enjoy build up a library of tutorials and articles.

- I've just launched a new website called [London Links][londonlinks], which is a curated list of useful websites for Londoners. Like a directory sites for essential living and London inspiration!
